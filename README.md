# Geometry

The project has two launchers.

# A normal launcher
Just like many simple programs, This class initialises the values to most of the objects
via the Random class by calling the nextDouble method.

# A reflections launcher
A second launcher class has been added to support the first class using reflections. Though 
not required. This has been done to understand the options available to initialize class and
variables, a different perspective.
